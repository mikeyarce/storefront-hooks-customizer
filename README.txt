Hook into Storefront from the Customizer!

== Description ==

The Storefront Hooks Customizer gives you the ability to add content to Storefront's template hooks through the WordPress Customizer.

**This plugin only works with Storefront and Storefront Child Themes**

You will be able to add content into the Header, Content, Homepage Template, and Footer sections of the Storefront theme.

Each hook is saved on a per-theme basis, so when you switch themes the options will be blank.  If you switch back, you will see the options added back.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `storefront-hooks-customizer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Make sure Storefront or a Storefront Child Theme is Activate
1. Navigate to Appearance > Customizer and to the "Storefront Hooks" Panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where did all my settings go? =
